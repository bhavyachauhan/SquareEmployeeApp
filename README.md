Cloning the repo and building the app should be pretty straight-forward. Please let me know if you run into any issues. 

This project uses Retrofit2 for network calls and is handling image loading and caching using [LRUCache](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/LruCache) and [LRUDiskCache](https://github.com/JakeWharton/DiskLruCache) with reference from [Bitmap Caching](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics/cache-bitmap). For UI flow, it is using the Master-Detail template that is shipped with Android Studio. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
